# Slot machine

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**
A minimalist slot machine.
The slot machine spins, performatically good, every 50ms (:
Since it uses React hooks and not everything is integrated with them, this is an experimental project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). â™¥

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm test -- --coverage`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode and also shows coverage.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
